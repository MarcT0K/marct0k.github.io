Since this post contains some criticism, a preliminary disclaimer is necessary. The conference was very well organized, and I congratulate the chairs for this great organization. Social events, food, venue, etc. everything was great. My criticism will be more on what is nowadays considered as good scientific work in the ML community. This criticism is obviously not limited to ML. I attended an ML conference, so I focus my criticism to this community even if I suppose that similar observations can be made in other communities. Hence, the concerns exposed in this post are not specific to ECML-PKDD or its organization but more to a scientific community.


# Discovering a scientific conference with fresh eyes

ECML-PKDD 2022 was my first in-person conference. I didn't know what to expect. Some of my colleagues told me about conferences they went to such as ICML, but I knew ECML-PKDD was a smaller. Anyway, even if it was as big as ICML, it was hard to picture exactly how it would feel. At first, I was a bit amazed by the fact that such big scientific event can happen while the general public totally ignore their existence.

As a PhD student, I was also overwhelmed by the program. So many subjects, so many papers, and among them, very few papers that I can fully understand.


# Disillusions

## Over-specialization

## Paper motivations

## Publish or perish

# Conclusion

## What about me? 

After all this criticism, you may want to confront me and ask whether I am such perfect scientist producing perfect scientific work with pure scientific motivations. First, I am literally nobody in the scientific community. I have two published papers, and I am early enough in my PhD not to worry about the moves I should do to preserve my academic career. However, my thoughts might be interesting because they confront the current scientific practices with the naive and ideal expectations of a PhD student.  

Undoubtedly, I will publish over-specialized papers (and already did!), I'll have papers with purely capitalistic motivations, etc. However, I'll also try to have scientific practices that converge as much as possible towards the ideals I had in me on September 19, 2022, when I arrived in ECML-PKDD.
