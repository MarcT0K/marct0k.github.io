# Academic context üè´

This project had been supervised by St√©phane Crozat (Assistant professor at the University of Technology of Compi√®gne) and Antoine Barbare (Engineer at Scaleway). The objective was to create introductory courses for classic courses or one-time trainings.

# Results üñß

I contributed in several parts of these courses:

* Corrected courses on VM, SSH and nginx.
* Wrote two courses on PostgreSQL administration: [G√©rer les connexions et les droits utilisateurs sous PostgreSQL](https://school.picasoft.net/modules/pg01/co/pg01.html) 
et [Sauvegarde et restauration d'une base de donn√©es sous PostgreSQL](https://school.picasoft.net/modules/pg02/co/pg02.html)
* Wrote a course on [DNS](https://school.picasoft.net/modules/dns01/co/dns01.html)
* XSL development
