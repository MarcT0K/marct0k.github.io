In this website, you'll find a bunch of interesting (and non-interesting) information about me. I'll describe my curriculum as well as my current research interests. On the other hand, I'll also try to regularly add new posts. My first posts present few academic projects I've done during my engineering diploma.

My future posts may concern different topics. Some will simply announce news about myself such as an accepted paper. Other posts will detail my thoughts about a technical or a scientific problem I study. In particular, I will some time try to give my gut feelings about some of my scientific contributions. Indeed, academic papers are reserved for concrete facts but, sometimes, it could be beneficial to provide some intuitions or vague ideas about a formal (and hard-to-grasp) publication.

Besides the engineer I am and the scientist I want to be, I am also an average citizen with his own metaphysical questions and ethics dilemmas. During my engineering diploma, I had the opportunity thanks to various courses or non-profit associations to develop some ethical concerns about sustainability, FOSS, technology, politics, etc. I don't exclude the possibility of writing some blog posts about such questions.

To conclude, if you want to exchange with me about my work or anything else, feel free to contact!
