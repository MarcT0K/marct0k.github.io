# Current status 🏫

I have obtained a Ph.D. in Applied Cryptography (titled *Privacy-Preserving Computations on Sparse Data*) in December 2025. As I finish my Ph.D., I am slowly starting to transition into industry. My goal is to find an unusual position at the intersection of academia and industry in order to build and deploy real-world privacy-enhancing technologies.

# Research Interests 🔬

I am interested in any privacy-enhancing technology. So far, I have worked on multiparty computation, searchable encrypted, and federated learning, but I am not attached to these primitives. My only motivation is to find real-world privacy problems, and to solve them using the best solutions.

If ever you are an non-profit organization and need support from a privacy engineer/researcher, please reach out to me! In the upcoming years, I am willing to dedicate part of my time to pro-bono research & development.

Besides these technical interests, I am open to many other topics. Especially, I am looking forward to any insights on ethics or environmental evaluation of computer systems. These elements essentially contribute to my personal reflections about my long-term role as a computer scientist in world facing multiple crisis.
