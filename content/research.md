# Current status 🏫

In October 2021, I started a PhD in Federated Learning between Inria Lille and the University of Twente. I am supervised by Jan Ramon (Inria Lille), Florian Hahn (UTwente) and Andreas Peter (UTwente/University of Oldenburg).

The goal of my thesis is to provide highly scalable and secure solutions for Federated Learning with a particular focus on ressource-constrained devices (e.g. smartphones).

# Research Interests 🔬

I have two main research interests are:

1. **Federated Learning**, especially its security aspect. Hence, I read papers about SMPC, Homomorphic Encryption, Function Secret Sharing, etc. My intent isn't to build highly complex ML systems but simply to propose generic secure building blocks for them.
2. **Searchable Encryption**. This is a subject on which I worked during a previous research internship with Florian Hahn and Andreas Peter. I still have some results and ideas that will result in occasional publications on this subject.

More generally, you can understand that my overall interest is in the privacy-preserving use of data.

Besides these concrete interests, I am open to many other publications. Especially, I am looking forward to any insights on ethics or environmental evaluation of computer systems. These elements essentially contribute to my personal reflections about my long-term role as a computer scientist in world facing multiple crisis.
