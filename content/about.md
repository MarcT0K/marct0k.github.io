# Short Bio üìï

I am a freshly graduated Computer engineer üéì interested in Cybersecurity and Data. I am currently a PhD student in privacy-preserving machine learning at the University of Twente üá≥üá± and Inria Lille üá´üá∑.
I am a geeky person ü§ì able to discuss in vain any new hype technology. But, on a more personal aspect, I am trying to figure out the place (and the sense) of computer systems in a sustainable world üåç.

If you are interested in my work (or my thoughts), please message me to discuss it!
