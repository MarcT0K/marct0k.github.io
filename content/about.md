# Short Bio 📕

I am a researcher and engineer in Privacy-Enhancing Technologies. I have a Ph.D. in Applied Cryptography and an MSc. in Data Mining.
I am a geeky person 🤓 able to discuss in vain any new hype technology. But, on a more personal aspect, I am trying to figure out the place (and the sense) of computer systems in a sustainable world 🌍.

If you are interested in my work (or my thoughts), please message me to discuss it!
