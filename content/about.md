# Short Bio üìï

I am a freshly graduated Computer engineer üéì interested in Cybersecurity and Data. I am currently a PhD student in Federated Learning between the University of Twente and Inria Lille.

I am some sort of geeky person ü§ì able to discuss in vain any new hype technology. On a more personal aspect, I am trying to figure out the place (and the sense) of computers in a sustainable world üåç.

If you are interested in my work (or in my thoughts), please feel free to send me a message so we can discuss!
