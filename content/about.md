# Short Bio 📕

I am a freshly graduated Computer engineer 🎓 interested in Cybersecurity and Data. I am currently a PhD student in privacy-preserving machine learning at the University of Twente 🇳🇱 and Inria Lille 🇫🇷.
I am a geeky person 🤓 able to discuss in vain any new hype technology. But, on a more personal aspect, I am trying to figure out the place (and the sense) of computer systems in a sustainable world 🌍.

If you are interested in my work (or my thoughts), please message me to discuss it!
